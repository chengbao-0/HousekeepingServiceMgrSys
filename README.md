# HousekeepingServiceMgrSys
This is a simple project for housekeeping service companies to manage the employment information of members and housekeeping staff.

Developed by Java+Mysql(jdbc)

The homework requirements for Java elementary school coursework are as follows:
1. Able to realize the division of labor management of domestic staff (health care, maintenance, nanny, nursing, etc.).
2. And realize the work time management of housekeeping staff.
3. After logging in, members can select the corresponding housekeeping staff according to the division of labor.
4. The system can automatically screen out several suitable housekeeping personnel through the time period, and members can choose.
5. Pay and score after the service is completed.

On this basis, I added a backup function, automatic backup function (not perfect) and some other functions.

For detailed database design, please restore by yourself according to sql backup records
